    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Linear Regression Architecture Workshop**.  \n",
    "This workshop is designed for college-level students learning both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Linear Regression** – a foundational algorithm in Machine Learning, focusing on predicting continuous values from a single feature.  \n",
    "2. **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** – design patterns and architectural considerations that make machine learning experiments reproducible, scalable, and production-ready.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **robot performance data** from the **Data Streaming Visualization Workshop** as our case study.  \n",
    "The goal is to not only understand how Linear Regression works, but also how to **design and implement a machine learning project** from sourcing data → building models → structuring code → preparing for deployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will be completed in **two 2-hour sessions**, with **homework assignments** to be completed before each class.  \n",
